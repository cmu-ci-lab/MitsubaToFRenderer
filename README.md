# MitsubaToFRenderer
Mitsuba renderer with support for time-of-flight rendering. 

**We recommend using docker**: adithyapedireda/mitsubatofrenderer that has preinstalled MitsubaToFRenderer and exr2mat.py and is tested on windows, mac and ubuntu20.04

For native installation, see INSTALL.txt for installation in ubuntu16.04 and INSTALL_20.04.txt for ubuntu20.04. 
Please check USAGE.txt for running the MitsubaToFRenderer with various settings. 
See INSTALLEXR2AVI.txt to install exr2avi scripts and view/save the exr output of the MitsubaToFRenderer as an image or video or process in MATLAB. 

You can run this renderer on AWS using two pre-configured AMIs with ID ami-28308957 (us-east-1, N. Virginia) and ami-00329ef32ac692d6c (us-east-2, Ohio). Both AMIs are compatible with [CfnCluster](https://cfncluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for easy distributed rendering.

The project is derived from https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/ and https://github.com/cmu-ci-lab/mitsuba_clt.git (for coded projector and coded camera extension). 
On top of these, the ToF renderer and ellipsoidal connections for time-gated rendering are added.
